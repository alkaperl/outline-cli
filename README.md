# Python CLI for Outline VPN

This is just a simple script to admin [Outline VPN](https://getoutline.org/) servers from the command line. This is great if you are, say, running 10 servers on various cloud providers---it's frankly abysmal as a tool for a single instance of Outline. The server manager application is far better for that.

Mainly, I need this to Bash script user creation and generation of invite links on scale. As I develop it, these needs will probably take the front seat.

The tool self-documenting using `-h/--help` and I'm trying to keep the code reasonably commented.
